    <h3>Element randomizer</h3>
    
    <p>Picks one child element at a time and executes it. You can either have it set to <code>wild</code> for truly random output, or <code>smart</code>, to avoid repetitions of previously used elements.</p>

    <h3>When to use?</h3>

	<p>Whenever you need random output, this element comes in handy. Some example usages might be randomized greetings/farewells, or perhaps random number guessing games.</p>

    <h3>How to use: </h3>
    <ol>
    	<li>
            For <b>Element Storage Mode</b>, pick <code>wild</code> if you do not care about repetition; this will execute elements wholly randomly. Otherwise, pick <code>smart</code>.<br>
            <ul>
                <li>If you picked <code>smart</code> for <b>Element Storage Mode</b>, you will need to enter any string of your choice for the <b>Namespace</b> property. This is the key under which previously executed elements will be stored to avoid repetition. You can share this key between multiple element randomizers too.</li>
                <li>
                    In addition, you will need to select the <b>Scope Type</b> from the drop-down, which dictates <i>how long</i> smart mode elements will be stored.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scope type <code>installation</code> stores the data for as long the skill is installed on any given device. This option preserves data the longest.</li>
                        <li>Scope type <code>session</code> stores the data for the duration of a session.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
