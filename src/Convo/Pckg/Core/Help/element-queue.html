<div class="element-queue-help">
    <h3>Element Queue</h3>
    <p>This element executes its child elements in sequence. You can decide how often it will check if they've been executed, i.e. once per request, session, or installation.</p>
    <p>Optionally, you may also put elements in a "Done" flow that will run if the Queue element is read again, but has already executed its elements in the given scope.</p>
    <p>You can also set the element to always re-read its children, without checking if it's been run already.</p>

    <h4>When to use?</h4>

    <p>When you have elements you wish to run in sequence, while having control over how often they run, and with an additional flow in case they've been executed.</p>

    <h4>How to use?</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Place whichever children elements you wish to execute in sequence in the <code>Elements</code> flow.</li>
        <li>Optionally, you may also add child elements to the <code>Done</code> flow which will run if the Queue element is read again, but has already executed its children.</li>
        <li>The <code>Should reset</code> property dictates whether or not to execute the <code>Done</code> flow once the queue has been executed, or to re-read the queue again.</li>
        <li><code>Scope type</code> governs how "often" the queue will run, if <code>Should reset</code> is toggled off. This essentially means, "read the queue once per installation/session/request".</li>
    </ul>
