    <h3>Yes No processor</h3>
    
    <p>A simple yes/no junction processor. This processor matches against "yes", "no", and variations thereof ("yep", "sure", "uh huh", "nope", "nah", etc.)
    </p>

    <h3>When to use?</h3>

    <p>If you're posing a simple yes/no question to the user, instead of having to mix and match simple processors and intents, you can use this predefined processor.</p>

    <h3>How to use: </h3>
    <ol>
    	<li>In the <b>Yes</b> flow, add elements you wish to execute if the user gives an affirmative response.</li>
		  <li>Conversely, add whichever elements you want if the user gives a negative answer in the <b>No</b> flow.</li>
    </ol>
