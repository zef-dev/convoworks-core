<div class="include-process-help">
    <h3>Include process fragment</h3>
    
    <p>Pick and include one of your predefined process fragments to help you reuse behavior.</p>

    <h3>When to use?</h3>

    <p>If you find yourself implementing the same processor setup in multiple places, it might be a good idea to extract it into a processor fragment and then reuse it wherever you need it. This removes repetition, and helps you change behavior if you need to.</p>

    <h3>How to use: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place this element where you wish to use your predefined fragment, and then choose it from the <b>Fragment ID</b> drop-down. This list is automatically populated.</li>
    </ol>
