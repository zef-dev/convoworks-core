<div class="goto-help">
    <h3>GOTO Element</h3>

    <p>Stops current block execution and continues with read flow of selected block.</p>

    <h3>When to use?</h3>

    <p>When we want to exit the current block and go to another block in the service and read it.</p>

    <h3>How to use: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a <b>BLOCK</b> from the drop-down list of available blocks</li>
        <li>Select <b>Wait for next</b> if you want to finish executing the current flow before going to the next state. On the next request, the read phase of the new state will be skipped and the request will immediately go through the process phase.
        If <b>Wait for next</b> is left false, the state will change immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
