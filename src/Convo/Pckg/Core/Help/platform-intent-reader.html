<div class="platform-intent-help">
    <h3>Platform Intent</h3>

    <p>Reads platform intents that have not been defined in the Convoworks editor. You can manually enter platform intents to be checked for in incoming requests.</p>

    <h3>When to use?</h3>

    <p>If there is an intent present on only one or a couple of vendors, but nowhere else (e.g. a specific Amazon built-in intent), you can use this filter to specifically deal with those cases.</p>

    <h3>How to use</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Write the name of the intent in the <b>Intent</b> field. This is <b>case sensitive.</b></li>
        <li>You can add <b>Predefined values</b> if you want to make them available on the <code>result</code> object.</li>
        <li>You can rename incoming slot values if you want to, by setting up <b>Rename values</b> pairs.</li>
        <li>
            <span>You also have access to captured slot values from an intent.</span>
            <p>Helpful Result variables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To capture a value of a slot i.e. city, use - <code>${result.city}</code></li>
                <li>To capture the entire structure of a platform slot i.e. city, use - <code>${result._city}</code></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
