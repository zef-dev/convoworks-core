<div class="platform-intent-help">
    <h3>Platform Intent</h3>
    
    <p>Reads platform intents that have not been defined in the Convoworks editor. You can manually enter platform intents to be checked for in incoming requests.</p>

    <h3>When to use?</h3>

    <p>If there is an intent present on only one or a couple of vendors, but nowhere else (e.g. a specific Amazon built-in intent), you can use this filter to specifically deal with those cases.</p>

    <h3>How to use</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Write the name of the intent in the <b>Intent</b> field. This is <b>case sensitive.</b></li>
        <li>You can add <b>Predefined values</b> if you want to make them available on the <code>result</code> object.</li>
        <li>You can rename incoming slot values if you want to, by setting up <b>Rename values</b> pairs.</li>
    </ol>
