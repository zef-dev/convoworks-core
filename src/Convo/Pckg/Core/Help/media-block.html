    <h3>Media Block</h3>
    
    <p>Serves for handling media playing requests (they are sessionless).</p>
    
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
        Audio players on the smart speaker devices are working a bit differently than the regular conversation services. Once you initiate the audio stream your service stops
        and the audio player takes control.
        <br>
        While in that mode the user can take just a few different actions, by voice or by tapping on the screen. Users can ask for the Next or Previous song, they can turn the loop and shuffle on and off.
        All these commands are handled automatically by the <b>Media Block</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        While executing the child flows (next not available, ...) you have access to the <b>media info</b> which you can use to enhance your responses. 
        E.g. "There are ${media_info.count} songs found and you are on the last one." 
    </p>
    <p>
        You also have access to the <b>last media info</b> in the entire service which you can use to enhance your resume functionalities.
        E.g. "There are <code>${last_media_info.post_index}</code> to resume the recently played song in the <code>Start Audio Playback</code> element."
