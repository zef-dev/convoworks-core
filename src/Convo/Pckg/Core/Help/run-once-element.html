<div class="run-once-help">
    <h3>Run once</h3>
    
    <p>Runs its child elements once per session or per installation.</p>

    <h3>When to use?</h3>

	<p>When you want to run something only once per installation on a device or per session. You can also use the <code>else</code> flow to execute something if the "run once" flow has already been executed. A particular example might be to offer the user help the first time they run the skill, and then redirect them elsewhere on subsequent runs.</p>

    <h3>How to use: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Choose the type of check you want from the <b>Run Once Per</b> dropdown.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Installation</b> is checked once per skill installation. This essentially equates to "run this only once and never again."</li>
                <li><b>Session</b> will run whichever elements once each time the user invokes your skill.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you want to run something else if the "run once" part has already been executed, you can add elements to the <code>else</code> flow.</li>
    </ol>
