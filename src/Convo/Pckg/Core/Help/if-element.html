<div class="if-help">
    <h3>IF element</h3>
    
    <p>Test against an expression and if it evaluates to a truthy value, execute the <b>Then</b> flow container. You can also add <code>Else If</code> elements into the <b>Else If</b> flow for additional cases. Lastly, you can add elements to the <b>Else</b> flow as a fallback.</p>

    <h3>When to use?</h3>

	<p>Whenever you have a condition that dictates the flow of a part of your skill, you can use this element to junction these possible outcomes.</p>

    <h3>How to use: </h3>
    <ol>
    	<li>In the <b>Test</b> field, enter any expression that you want to evaluate. For example, <code>${result.number == correctNumber}</code></li>
        <li>Add the elements you wish to execute if the expression is truthy in the <b>Then</b> flow.</li>
        <li>In the <b>Else If</b> flow, you can place special <code>Else If</code> elements that also have a <b>Test</b> property and a <b>Then</b> flow. These can be used to test for other cases so that you don't have to chain <code>If</code> elements.</li>
        <li>Lastly, in the <b>Else</b> flow, you can place elements that will trigger in case the expression evaluates to a falsy value.</li>
    </ol>
