<div class="comment-help">
    <h3>Editor Comment</h3>
    
    <p>A simple element that's used for leaving a comment in the editor. This will not affect the service's runtime.</p>

    <h3>When to use?</h3>

    <p>Comments are generally useful for short notes, reminders, and explanations. Try not to go overboard; well structured services (and bodies of code) are for the most part self explanatory.</p>

    <h3>How to use:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the element inside the editor, and write a comment. Simple.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
