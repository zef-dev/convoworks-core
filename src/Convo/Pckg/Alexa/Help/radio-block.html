    <h3>Radio Block</h3>

    <p>Serves for handling radio playing requests (they are sessionless).</p>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
        Radio players on the smart speaker devices are working a bit differently than regular audio streaming services. Once you initiate the radio stream your service stops
        and the radio block takes control.
        <br>
        While in that mode the user can take just a few different actions, by voice or by tapping on the screen.
        However, most of the commands and actions are not supported like in the regular audio player.
        For instance, you can't shuffle or loop the radio stream since this is a continuous stream which technically doesn't end.
        Since this block is specific for radio streams we also don't support "next" and "previous" commands.
        All these commands are handled automatically by the <b>Radio Block</b>.
    </p>
    <p>For more info on un supported command, please take alo look below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>start over</li>
        <li>repeat</li>
        <li>next</li>
        <li>previous</li>
        <li>loop on</li>
        <li>loop off</li>
        <li>shuffle on</li>
        <li>shuffle off</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        While executing the child flows (action not supported and fallback), you can say something like: E.g. "This action is not supported fot the current stream."
